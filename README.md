> Word bound detection with flexible rule-based approach and varying implementations to choose from

</div>

## Usage

`word_bounds` crate is intended to help detect word bounds and split up longer strings into smaller segments
based on rules that can be customized to fit your needs.

The rules allow flexible segmenting, for example, by either detecting chars as their own segments (words), bind them
together with the ongoing segment, or start the next segment with it. The rules also allow for removing or retaining
any chars, and has a customizable "sense" of punctuation chars (i.e you can detect words by underscores, whitespace,
etc.).

## Implementations & Performance

This repository currently contains three different methods to perform word bounds resolution - with standard `regex`
crate,
with `fancy_regex` crate, and a custom regexless char-walking version.

The performance of these methods is evaluated using `criterion`
benchmarking library. See [benches/segmentation.rs](benches/segmentation.rs) for the benchmarking code and
try it yourself. Here are the latest results on a macbook air m1 (which shows the relational performance, while the
exacts
will of course vary by system etc.):

| Trait                         | Execution Time       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WordBoundResolverRegex`      | 119.09  ¬µs (average) | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Major WIP** </br>(More) Accurate, but currently ~50x slower than `WordBoundResolverCharwalk`. Based on prior proof-of-concepts, we should ultimately land at around ~3x slower than the charwalk variant. Suitable for non-critical performance paths. |
| `WordBoundResolverFancyRegex` | 15.433  ¬µs (average) | üöß **WIP, but almost there** </br>All-inclusive regex logic including lookahead/lookback, which should be even more accurate, but ~7x slower than `WordBoundResolverCharwalk`. Use only when other variants fail.                                           |
| `WordBoundResolverCharwalk`   | 2.4 ¬µs (average)     | ‚ùé **Just needs more optimization** </br>Fastest and simplest, but could fail on certain edge cases. Officially suggested method for common cases.                                                                                                           |

The `criterion` benchmark results show that `WordBoundResolverCharwalk` is the fastest yet simplest method, taking only
about
2.4 ¬µs on average per the benchmarking execution. The regex variants can be more accurate, and their logic is
using a tried and
tested framework, but they are significantly more expensive to run; the `WordBoundResolverRegex` that has no integrated
lookahead/lookback features, replaces this absence with a custom post-process pass, and should be about 3 times slower
than the
`WordBoundResolverCharwalk` variant (‚ö†Ô∏è *but is under construction, and while it passes the tests, it's 50x slower at
the moment* ‚ö†Ô∏è). The
`WordBoundResolverFancyRegex` which makes use of the regex
engine for all of
its logic (including
lookahead/lookback), is more than 7 times slower than the `WordBoundResolverCharwalk` variant, though should yield
the most accurate results.

The official suggestion is to use `WordBoundResolverCharwalk` (i.e neither `use_regex`
nor `use_fancy_regex` features are enabled),
unless you face an edge case that isn't covered yet in the manual parsing logic. After that, you should test whether
`WordBoundResolverRegex` works, and if not, try `WordBoundResolverFancyRegex`.

> Note: Ultimately the costs are not usually all that significant, since this
